# Magzyne
Magzyne - Create your "staticly-hostable" news aggregator site within minutes.

## What is this?
Magzyne aims to become a go-to framework for people who want to host news aggregator sites. All this, while ensuring 0 hosting cost (generates completely static output). This is done by creating a CRON github action which puts data into github issue and frontend reads from there.

## Features
✅ Create a fully static news aggregator site.<br>
✅ 0 config scraping - use `@magzyne/scraper` & just write scraping logic. Magzyne takes over from there.<br>
✅ Full SEO & meta customization options on generated sites.<br>

## How to use it? Where is documentation?
Currently project is very very small and self explanatory.<br>
It hardly requires 2 files to get frontend ready and just the scraping logic to setup workflows.
